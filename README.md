# Azure-Network-Diagram
Using my free trial of Microsoft Azure, I created a highly available web server for a hypothetical company to use for testing and training. 

This diagram is a detailed visualization of the cloud infrastructure and how all the resources are connected. It contains the following components:

Azure Resource Group, Virtual Network with IP address Range & Subnet Range, Docker Container, Ansible Jump Box, Network Security Group, Load Balancer, 3 Virtual Machines, Flow of HTTP & SSH Traffic

*draw.io was used to create diagram
